            <p>
                My name is Ryan Colosanti. I am an aspiring game designer currently based in between Richmond, Virginia
                and
                Williamsburg, Virginia. I have always had a passion for video games from the first time I played
                Pokemon Blue
                on the Gameboy Color. They have always been a way for me to relax and escape for a brief period
                of time. I love being a part of the many different worlds and discovering all of their secrets. Now I
                want to give that same feeling adventure and wonder to other people of all walks of life by creating
                the same video games that make me excited to pick up a controller and turn on the console.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, you will find a multitude of projects I have completed in the past six months during a coding
                boot camp. These projects were made with real professional work and in-demand skills in mind. While
                these projects are focus on web development, I am also spending my personal time learning how to design
                and write code for video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I chose a path in development, I graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor of
                Arts in History. What draws me to history is the storytelling aspect. I love reading and hearing about
                all the different events that happened, from the fantastic to the mundane. Itâ€™s like hearing a tale
                from a totally different world.
            </p>
            <p>
                When not writing code, I spend my free time playing video games, reading fiction (usually fantasy), or
                watching sports. Outside the house, I enjoy exploring museums and tasting local craft beers.
